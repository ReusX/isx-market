/**
 * نبض السوق — the model behind /pulse.
 *
 * Ported from `/Users/amed/iqwealth-design/app/pulse/pulseData.ts`. Every
 * formula, threshold and printed rule string below is the approved reference's
 * own. What changed is where the numbers come from, and one correction the
 * reference could not make because its mock data had no such case.
 *
 * ── The correction: breadth is four-state here, not three ─────────────────
 * `breadth_daily` stores `advancers` / `decliners` / `unchanged` and nothing
 * else. It is not wrong, but it answers a different question than this page
 * asks: it compares each company against ITS OWN previous traded close, not
 * against the previous session. Rebuilding it from `company_metrics.prev_close`
 * reproduces a stored row to the unit — for 2026-08-20, 8 / 15 / 17 with
 * `up_volume` 224,607,641 and `down_volume` 154,226,373, all four exact.
 *
 * The consequence is that it has no place to put a company that traded today
 * and did not trade in the previous session, so those companies land in
 * `unchanged`. On 2026-08-20 that is seven of them, and «ثابت 17» is then a
 * statement about thirteen flat companies and seven unmeasurable ones. This
 * product's rule is that a missing comparison is not a zero, so:
 *
 *   · the CURRENT session is counted live from `daily_prices` against the
 *     previous session's closes, giving up / down / flat / noPrior;
 *   · the HISTORY series keeps `breadth_daily`, which is the only source that
 *     goes back to 2010, and is labelled with its own definition.
 *
 * `noPrior` is therefore `number` for the live session and `null` for a
 * historical row — null meaning "this source cannot say", never zero.
